# Service Delivery Indicators

The Service Delivery Indicators (SDI) provide a set of metrics for benchmarking service delivery performance in education and health. The overall objective of the indicators is to gauge the quality of service delivery in primary education and basic health services. The indicators enable the identification of gaps and tracking of progress over time and across countries. It is envisaged that the broad availability, high public awareness, and a persistent focus on the indicators will mobilize policymakers, citizens, service providers, donors, and other stakeholders for action to improve the quality of services and ultimately to improve development outcomes and social welfare. See [http://www.sdindicators.org](http://www.sdindicators.org) for more information.

# Using this Respository

This repository contains de-identified data from ten rounds of SDI data on health facilities across nine countries. It provides code to clean and harmonize these into a single "Service Delivery Indicators Health Surveys" dataset, containing background information and vignettes results for 10,230 provider interactions. This data can be freely used to conduct analysis, and this repo serves as a central clearinghouse for comments and improvements that are needed in the harmonization of the data.
